<h1> so why using it instead of writing our own script? </h1>
<ul>
  <li> because the scripts are already done.... why redoing the same
thing ?</li>
  <li> because your ./configure script will be smaller then easier to
check</li>
</ul>
<h1>What are the limitations ?<br>
</h1>
I don't bother supporting old non-POSIX OS, the reason is simple :<br>
"what is the purpose of creating an out of speed package if this is
to make it run on a slowass/outdated system?"<br>
my goal is to provide portability as long as portability don't means
"create features that will make it slower or harder to maintain". <br>
this
is a "go higher, even higher" rule<br>
<br>
doing so, the script will fail if a tool don't support POSIX/X-Open
conformance. This is a way to test your conformance too. This is the
case of echo...<br>
if you want your out-of speed package to run on outdated OS, choose
autoconf!<br>
<br>
I know this is a little selfish but in a world where <big
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">free</big>
OS exists
there are no reason to stuck with trash (note that what I call trash
is outdated packages, an atari st with linux isn't a trash ^_^)<br>
if you're not happy with this, write to your OS provider to complain ^_^<br>
<br>
the Makefile templates included are GNU make compatible. I think the
lisibility of include functionnality (the fact we can include a
makefile
like a #include in C) prevails over portability (anyway GMake is
portable so portability is acheived...). This help create small
makefiles (about 10 lines) increasing then ease of maintaining, ease of
extention..... One of the main goal is to provide a K.I.S.S compatible
framework (Keep It Simple Stupid : don't try to over add
functionnalities, split it ! make a programm that do a precise task not
everything, perfect exemples are cp, mv, ln, awk tools, a perfect
counter exemple is perl that try to do everything at the price of high
complexibility) nothing prevent you from not using included
templates.....<br>
I'm sorry to say that POSIX didn't made a choice concerning include
functionality..........<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>What are the alternatives?</h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.scons.org/">scons</a> is one</li>
  <li>automake, autoconf, libtool, pkgconfig </li>
</ul>
<h2>Scons related thougth</h2>
yesterday I was talking with a fan of scons... of course the discussion
was animated ^_^ (will vim or emacs be the best editor?... O_o oups....
not the right logfile ^_^)<br>
<ul>
  <li>one thing he told me is that "make was used to perform tasks that
he is not designed to" : I didn't noticed this first but it comes back
to my memory now... In fact make is exactly used to perform task that
he was designed for : track dependencies....</li>
  <li>the debugability issue was then aborded : of course make is an
hard to debug tool because he can execute things in perfect outoforder
fashion... this give him the abilitiy to run several jobs in parallel,
to make distributed compile and so fancy things.... but there are ways
to debug it :</li>
  <ul>
    <li>-d for debug mode<br>
    </li>
    <li>-p&nbsp;&nbsp; Print&nbsp; the&nbsp; data&nbsp; base&nbsp;
(rules&nbsp; and variable values) that results from reading the
makefiles</li>
    <li>-r&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliminate use of the built-in implicit rules</li>
    <li>-n&nbsp;&nbsp; Print the commands that would be executed, but
do not execute them.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>then the QT moc compiler stuff was aborded.... this wasn't an
issue... in fact I think that QT made a big mistake with their cpp
files, because they had to be processed by moc compiler first they
aren't cpp file anymore... maybe a good extension should have been .cqt
. Anyway, there is plenty of ways to create the right rules on way is
to use partial file (my knowledge lack in moc related stuff, but if i'm
correct the moc compiler extract informations of cpp file and output
them in a file) so make %.o depends on %.moc and add a rule to create
the moc file is one way.....</li>
  <li>he told me about regular expression in make, for me %.o : %.c is
perfectly readable... I know about the partern... anyone that used
posix regular expression will not have anytrouble with this...</li>
  <li>he told me about the variables..... do you find $(myvar)
unreadble? in fact anyone that is used to sh scripting wont... I think
that make is even more readable than sh because it has only two way of
referencing the content of a variable : $(myvar) or ${myvar} (note that
the second is usable in sh too ^_^</li>
  <li>he told me about cached compile (he wanted to have several
configuration builds directories), scons do it, as it is possible with
make... the
vpath method is one, the links farms are anothers.... I prefer not to
rely on a cached mecanism since it can become buggy and will force you
to recompile everything by default like too much people do.... I prefer
to have separate build directories
that will remain consistent, this is much more clean and error
proof.... again this is mor KISS compatible to my point of view....</li>
  <li>then he talked about ease of automatic parsing by tools....
experience showed me that this is easier to write your makefiles than
to fight against a tool that don't do your fancy compiling
behaviour.... then the perfect counter exemple is the&nbsp; simplicity
achieved into the<a href="Makefiles%20templates.html"> templates</a> <br>
  </li>
  <li>then it require python... that is not widely installed and
"waste" lot of space on disc if you only require it to compile<br>
  </li>
  <li>of course it's more portable.... but as I said portability is to
my point of view only POSIX... standards are made for this....</li>
</ul>
<h1> why is it better than autoconf?<br>
</h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://freeopenml.berlios.de/againstautotools.html">because</a><br>
  </li>
  <li> because you have the entire control of HOW the config.h is build
    <a
 href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/confiserie/trunk/confiserie/configure_templates/configure.template">see
this for an exemple of complex output policy</a><br>
  </li>
  <li> because it's easier to read</li>
  <li> because you can easely figure what script failed and fix it if
needed you don't have to look into logs and process a 100000000+
lines script&nbsp; just add a "set -x" at begin of the incrimined
script and a "set +x" at end re-run the tests..... and see what you
need</li>
  <li>because scripts will output errors of LD, CC... directly letting
know when something is really wrong without reading a file.....</li>
  <li>because you easely add behaviour modification like --enable-xx or
--disable-yyy&nbsp;&nbsp; (confiserie init.sh only provide some all
package wide enable/disable like --prefix=)</li>
  <li>because it's more historical unix behaviour compliant (which is
more simplier&nbsp; and used widely like CFLAGS env, CXXFLAGS,
LD_FLAGS...) : set up your building environnement : you're the master
of "how,when,where,why,who,what"</li>
  <li>because it'll produce more LinuxFS/historical unix tree compliant
installed tree : autoconf allow you to set some install directories
that can produce&nbsp; an unorganized FS yes this is a lack of
flexibility but experience tend to show that even distro builders
like Mandrake (fixed now but they have done it in past) don't bother
setting correct --prefix resulting having
most package installed into /usr/local..... which is a reserved
directory for SA testing..... I assume here that an average SA know
what he's doing and if really testing a package will set the correct
--prefix..... other SA that don't know are newbies and then will have
the correct behaviour : --prefix=/usr</li>
  <li>because it assume that you know how to compile a thing, because
it'll learn users how to use an UNIX compiler environnement, my
experience shows that when I teach other about CFLAGS and other
environnement variables they are astonished and wonder why such thing
isn't known.... look : what is better to have a set of package built
the same way? issue a ./configure&nbsp; at each build with the rights
options or set once for all the CFLAGS&nbsp; LDFLAGS.... (which can
be automated in a bashrc....)<br>

<h1>What is a link farm?</h1>
this paragraph is related to building into another directory ie not
poluting the sources.<br>
there is 3 historical behaviours<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -copy the sources <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -make link farms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -VPATH (OBJDIR....)<br>
<br>
copy of the sources is the obvious solution but has a lot of drawbacks
like the impossibility to modify the sources into current directory
which make it unpracticable and this is space consuming<br>
<br>
link farms is a derivative of the copy method, that consist of creating
a shadow copy of the sources into another directory by creating a set
of
links from the shadow to the sources files. The drawbacks are the
creation time of the shadow copy (tests tends to prove that this time
is
negligeable t least under linux), and the fact that we work on the link
(ie getting the
real modification times&nbsp; require a ls -L), the obvious benefit is
that we can directly work on the&nbsp; shadow copy making the creation
step more easy.<br>
<br>
last is to use VPATH feature of gnu make. no drawbacks unless the fact
we have 2 really distinctive tree (one is the sources, the other is the
objects)&nbsp; making the work of a developper more hard (unless
everything goes right, case that happens on production only ) and that
the package must have been designed to handle this special case.<br>
<br>
confiserie will handle both case : link farms and VPATH, because link
farms is dangerous when working in same directory as sources (and that
the detection mechanism don't work well... it will be made an option of
confiserie)<br>
I choosed link farms because the overhead of creating the links was
really small, because it allow to work in the builddir transparently
and
because it simplify the makefile creation overhead.<br>
<br>
the problem when creating a link farm (this issue is still true with
VPATH) is that we run the configure step under another tree, this means
that ./confiserie/* aren't accessible easely.... so we need to figure
were we are... (where the source is located). If Unix designer weren't
gods this will be impossible task : we always know where we are runned
but not where we are located...... BUT ^_^ unix designer created the $0
argument : the complete string from which we are invoqued..... <br>
example : <br>
/test/toto/tata/configure --prefix=/usr will have a $0 of
/test/toto/tata/configure.....&nbsp; a small awk magical line and
miracle we can create a $confiserie variable ^_^<br>
this makes a dependency upon awk that is already a requirement......<br>
