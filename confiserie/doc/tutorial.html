        <h1> tutorial for using confiserie in a project</h1>
        this tutorial is taken from my own experience when I tried to 
        use confiserie in my own projects.</br>
        this isn't intended to show all the cases but rather to give a method 
        on how to do it</br>
        <h2> hypotesis </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>the project is in c++</li>
            <li>we are using a third party library that use pkgconfig</li>
            <li>we are using auto app feature of confiserie</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>writing the configure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I copied the configure located into example directory</li>
            <li>modify the custom_clean_on_sig function so that it will remove
                all the created files</li>
            <li>now customise the includes</li>
            <ul>
                <li> we are creating a C++ auto app : include ${confiserie}/CXX/Makefile.autoapp</li>
                <li> auto app just provide a way to convert some makefiles
                variables into real compile makefile, it don't provide the
                rules used for compilation itself, so we need some rule
                provider, confiserie provide one : ${confiserie}/CXX/Makefile.beautifull_rules</li>
                <li> since I use vim as a text editor, I want to have some tags 
                for fast browsing : ${confiserie}/Makefiles/Makefile.tags</li>
                <li> during development step it is usefull to track header
                dependencies (this is less usefull during deployment but don't
                take too much compile time so it's a good idea to keep this
                feature activated) : include ${confiserie}/CXX/Makefile.auto_headers_deps </li>
            </ul>
            <li> ok I think I have all the makefiles helpers I need for my
            dev, time to move to the real requirements checks</li>
            <ul>
                <li> it's a c++ application, so we need to check if
                there is a c++ compiler at least, since it's a test
                it have to be run at configure time, so prefix it with
                runtest directive : runtest ${confiserie}/CXX/test_cxx.sh</li>
                <li>the c++ program rely on a third party library that
                use pkgconfig : runtest ${confiserie}/pkg-config/test_pkg-config.sh</li>
            </ul>
            <li>now that we have included all the dependecies (not tested at
            confugure time but used to have the confiserie tree well filed), 
            and that we have setup all the test, we have to run it once, for this
            we need to end the test with finish_confiserie</li>
        </ul>
        now run it and check the log displayed</br>
        at end of the log a summary of modified/set environment variable is 
        displayed</br>
        confiserie script do use environment variable to communicate, nothing is
        produced by confiserie tests, only the environement of the configure
        itself is modified, at the end configure script will only show you
        what worth to be used in your headers or makefiles has been set
        or has been modified.</br>
        last step is to save the state, it's again you that choose what has to be
        saved, you do it using 2 functions : create_makefile and create_include.<br>
        both take at first argument a filename, and a list of environment
        variable to save, you only choose the ones that are relevant for your
        use..<br>
        example : create_makefile Makefile.confiserie TOPSRC_DIR OBJDIR confiserie INSTALL_PREFIX BIN_DIR SBIN_DIR LIB_DIR LIBEXEC_DIR SYS_CONF SHARED_DATA_DIR INCLUDE_DIR WHICH CXX CXXFLAGS CPPFLAGS CXX_LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR
        <h2>writing the makefiles</h2>
        ok we done the configure, saved the result into a Makefile.confiserie
        and now?<br>
        we have to create the Makefiles!<br>
        <ul>
            <li>top source dir</li>
            <ul>
                <li> this is the simpliest : in make_templates of 
                confiserie you will find several prewritten makefiles, and in
                particular Makefile.topsource_dir,</li>
                <li> just copy it to your top
                source dir, rename it into Makefile for convinience</li>
                <li> edit it, seek for subdirs variable, add the dirs where
                make shall perform some task</li>
                <li> at the end add your Makefiles's includes : 
                include ${TOPSRC_DIR}/Makefile.confiserie</li>
            </ul>
            <li> program directory</li>
            <ul>
                <li> here are our program sources, where the real work is done we
                wanted to not bother and use an automatic target creation makefile
                that looks like an automake configure file</li>
                <li> copy Makefile.app_auto from make_templates dir and rename
                it into Makefile</li>
                <li> it's a c++ program that shall be installed into 
                ${prefix}/bin. We have to define bin_CXXPROGRAMS variable with
                our program list (here only one : gpx_geotag)<li>
                <li> we have to say what are the sources (not headers) of
                gpx_geotag : gpx_geotag_SOURCES =  gpx_geotag.cpp</li>
                <li> last we have to make "make" aware of the confiserie helpers</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>include ${confiserie}/CXX/Makefile.autoapp</li>
                    <li>include ${confiserie}/CXX/Makefile.beautifull_rules (
                    remember : autoapp don't provide the build rule for allowing
                    user to define it's own)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li> run ./configure and make</li>
        </ul>
        that's all, now we want to add another feature : dependency traking
        <ul>
            <li>looking into Makefile.auto_headers_deps we see in the comment
            that for using it we need </li>
            <ul>
                <li>add the line "-include ${gpx_geotag_SOURCES:%.cpp=GENERATED/%.d}"
                into our makefile</li>
                <li> add include ${confiserie}/CXX/Makefile.auto_headers_deps</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    that's all, we have writen a top source makefile that will lauch make into
    the sources subdirs, added a makefile into the souces subdirs that contain a
    way to create makefiles to build/install the program, contain a way to 
    compile our sources, contain a way to track dependencies so that if a header
    is modified, only relevant sources are rebuild (note that this step is only
    usefull when writing the software, since for integrator/end builder it has
    no use (they won't likely modify headers and then do a build/modify/build 
    cycle) [TODO: add into the tutorial the way to use it as an option into 
    configure
