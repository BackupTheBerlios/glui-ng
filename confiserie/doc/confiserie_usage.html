	<h1>What will it produce?</h1>
	NOTHING<br>
	O_o o_O! <br>
	what the purpose of nothing? I leave this to you : do what you want<br>
	just look at the <a href="confiserie_extension.html#output">wanted
		behaviour</a> of test scripts<br>
	and on the <a href="configure%20exemples.html">exemples</a><br>
	<br>
	well to tell the truth.... it will create a .config.cache file... that can
	be converted to a header with the 
	<p class="code">${confiserie}/C/convert_cache_to_header.sh
	path/to/some/cachefile</p>
	or into a makefile with the
	<p	class="code">${confiserie}/Makefiles/convert_cache_to_makefile.sh
	path/to/some/cachefile</p>
	
	<br>
	<h1>OK then HOW will it work? How can I use it?</h1>
	<ul class="none">
		<li>you might want to see the 
		<a href="configure%20exemples.html">exemples</a>
		</li>
		<li>you create an sh script like every sh script (read the bash guide on
		tldp.org) this script will call tests that are located into confiserie
		subdir of your topsource directory.	</li>
		
		<li>in this script you call test scripts that can easely be recognised
		because each call to a test script MUST begin with the prefix 
		<span class="code"> ${confiserie}/ </span></li>
		<li>each test script return 0 on success and an error (!=0) on failure
		(UNIX common behaviour)&nbsp; and output result on stdout, you can then
		redirect results into the wanted file....</li>
		<li>
		each script ought to cache result into .configure.cache.new to faster tests
		</li>
		<li>
		stderr is always used in thoses scripts to provide user feedback
		(output messages on console)
		</li>
		<li>
		first thing to do is to create a 
		<a href="configure%20exemples.html#real_exemple">testscript</a> 
		or use a
		<a href="configure%20exemples.html#templates"> template</a>:
		<ul class="none">
			<li>include in your script every tests you want </li>
			<li>there is typically 2 types of tests : <a
				href="confiserie_extension.html#tests">utilities tests and compilation
				tests.</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		once the ./configure test is writen you need to "napper" the package ie add 
		the required scripts : 
		</li>
		<p class="code"> $ napper path/to/the/package	</p>
		<li>
		it'll :
		<ul>
			<li>parse the configure for ${confiserie}/* strings</li>
			<li>copy the tests and the requirements to confiserie directory</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<ul class="note">note <br>
			that the confiserie directory is dedicated to tests, you can use
			it to store your own tests (thanks to napper intelligence)
		</ul>
		<li>
		that's all
		</li>
		<li>
		you should be aware of <a
			href="http://confiserie.berlios.de/confiserie_extension.html#output">output
			policy of confiserie</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2> how can I find which scripts are available?</h2>
	you should look into /usr/share/confiserie/ dir (default install dir) <br>
	or
	<p class="code"> $ find / -type d -name confiserie </p>
	or<br>
	<p class="code"> $ cat /etc/confiser.conf	</p>
	or<br>
	<p class="code"> $ napper --copy-all /path/to/sources</p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>how can I include automatically the scripts needed to my
		sources?</h2>
	<p class="code">$ napper /path/to/sources</p>
	
	<h2>I saw that there are makefiles in you tests?</h2>
	this is normal, confiserie allow any kind of files....<br>
	those makefiles are provided to give user already written rules, so
	they don't have to re-create them....<br>
	there is several way to use them<br>
	<ul>
		<li>in configure script notice that you're using some helper Makefile
		by adding
		<p class="code">include  ${confiserie}/some_helper_makefile </p>
		then include the Makefile into the Makefiles that require them
		like in <a
			href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/confiserie/trunk/confiserie/make_templates/Makefile.app_auto?view=markup">Makefile.app_auto
			template</a> (at bottom)<br>
		</li>
		<ul>
		<li>simply cat them to your 'result' makefile : add in your
		testscript the line 
		<p class="code">cat ${confiserie}/Makefile.beautifull_rules	&gt;&gt; mymakefile </p>
		</li>
		<li>use make include feature : add in your testscript the line 
		<p class="code">include ${confiserie}/C/Makefile.beautifull_rules</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	if you don't want to be bound to make include feature... you can but
	this is not recommanded because you can't use autodep features, you
	can't use auto creation of library and applications with a list of
	sources.....<br>
	remember gnu make is portable, free of charge.... <span
		style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">why</span> not
	use it?<br>
	<h2>how can I use config.h?</h2>
	do a <span class="code"> #include "config.h" </span> in your sources (or whatever you have created
	: config.h is only a common name)<br>
	<ul class="note">
		DON'T USE CLASSICAL AUTOCONF	BEHAVIOUR FOR config.h : <br> 
		#ifdef&nbsp; HAVE_CONFIG_H<br>
		#inlcude "config.h"<br>
		#endif<br>
		because this is absurd : you have a configure script that perform some
		test and enable/disable features, there is no "logical" aim to compile
		with and without the config file....<br>
	</ul>
	<h1>how can I add optional features in my configure</h1>
	there is a special variable called CONFIGURE_OPTS which is an erray
	containing strings...
	<p class="code">
	CONFIGURE_OPTS[index]="option,variable_to_set,description,defaultvalue"
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>index is an integer beginning at 1</li>
		<li>option is string identifier like <span class="code">--prefix=</span>
		it has been chosen to follow autoconf behaviour and then to not use
		<span class="code">option &lt;space&gt; value</span> but 
		<span class="code">option=value</span>
		</li>
		<li>variable to set is the name of the variable to modify for example PREFIX</li>
		<li>description is the description of the option, it's an arbritary string
		displayed into help<br> 
		for example : configure package to be located in prefix [path]<br>
		it's advised to give a hint of the possible values inside [] (like
		[path], [YES|NO]....)<br>
		</li>
		<li>
		the last option is the default value to use, if this string is empty no
		value is stored
		</li>
	</ul>
	init.sh provide 3 additional options : --prefix=, -h, -V, which are the
	configuration prefix, display help and exit, version and exit<br>
	display help will create the help according to the values in
	CONFIGURE_OPTS<br>
	<br>
	<h1>how to automaticly clean on error?</h1>
	provide a <span class="code">custom_clean_on_sig</span> bash function <br>
	this function will be registered by init.sh as an interrupt/signal
	handler for Ctrl+C like signals<br>
	<br>
	then write the configure script the following way :
	<pre class="code">
	#!/bin/sh
	. $confiserie/init.sh "$@" &&
	(
	...... &&
	...... &&
	)||clean_on_sig
	</pre>
	<ul class="note"> IMPORTANT <br>
	init.sh provide a function clean_on_sig which is the function used to 
	clean, this function will call custom_clean_on_sig if it is declared
	don't redefine this function unless you know what you're doing...
	</ul>
	<ul class="note">note the following points:
		<ul>
			<li>the tests are run in a sub shell ie	inside a '(' ')' pair</li>
			<li>we didn't bothered making if else	constructs : &amp;&amp; will
		 	execute the next test only if the previous was successfull</li>
			<li> we use || to perform a default action if	the test were not 
			successfull : || execute the next function only if the previous 
			wasn't successfull, since the previous is the subshell that	will
		 	fail on requirement missing</li>
			<li>we use clean_on_sig function that is defined by user, this
			function is normally used to clean everything on signal reception....
			but nothing prevent using it for cleaning	pupose ^_^</li>
			<li>if you want to have variables exported then use functions instead
			of subshell or group of instructions ( replace '(' by '{' and ')' by '}')
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<h1><a name="outofspeed"></a>How can make it run outofspeed/extend it
		intelligently?</h1>
	napper is a intelligent tool : it only update the scripts that he
	installed leaving the other script/file in confiserie directory<br>
	this means that you can safely use this directory to store your own
	test/configuration files ^_^<br>
	particulary one big advantage over autoconf is that you can use SOURCE
	files : by source I mean : Makefile, C/C++ source or headers, anything
	compilable with a compiler, scripts..... shortly : everything ^_^<br>
	why such feature? simply because rather than creating the source at run
	time (autoconf behaviour) we prefer to use already present files<br>
	this has several advantages :<br>
	<ul>
		<li>a ./configure script isn't simply a script but a complet test
		suite : it's easely extented and other compilers can easely be added</li>
		<li>you can group your tests : when your application <span
			style="text-decoration: underline;">require</span> a set of headers/
		headers functionnality group them into a source file (note the concept
		:
		you write your application in a certain language, you then know well
		this language, it's then simplier to write a source file and test
		it....) this will save lot of compilation time</li>
		<li>you can test if some functions are supported directly<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	exemple :<br>
	imagine you need several headers : unistd.h OpenML/OpenML.h string.h<br>
	imagine you need POSIX compliance : _POSIX_JOB_CONTROL _POSIX_SAVED_IDS<br>
	imagine you need C99 compliance<br>
	<pre class="code">
	#define _ISOC99_SOURCE
	#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 199309L
	#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
	#include &lt;OpenML/OpenML.h&gt;
	#include &lt;string.h&gt;
	#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

	#ifndef _POSIX_JOB_CONTROL
	#error Job control is not supported
	#endif
	#ifndef _POSIX_SAVED_IDS 
	#error posix saved ids not supported 
	#endif

	int main (int argc, char** argv) 
	{
		uint16_t type1; //C99type
		type1=1;
		printf("type1 : %d",type1);
	}
	</pre>
	and a script like this :
	<p class="code">
	export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -l totest1 -l totest2"<br>
	$confiserie/test_compile_c.sh $confiserie/mytest.c<br>
	</p>
	<ul>
		will do in a single shot the following tests :
		<ul>
			<li>test 3 headers presence and usability</li>
			<li>test fonctionnality of building environnement</li>
			<li>test a function presence and usablity (printf)</li>
			<li>try to link with library libtotest1 and libtotest2</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	this is the recommanded way to perform required tests, or to extend for
	a particular functionality (imagine you provide a library, giving a
	source and a script can easely extend the condiserie package)<br>
	<br>
	<ul class="note">NOTE <br>
	don't try to run the compiled	source
	after : this is uneeded and may cause false behaviour in case of
	crosscompiling, compiling and linking are sufficient to test the
	requirement. This has a side effect : you don't need to bother making a
	working programm but only a compilable one ^_^
	</ul>
	<ul class="note">NOTE2<br>
	when modifying the CFLAGS/LDFLAGS
	and other environnement variable dont forget to include a
	$THEVARIABLEYOURMODIFYING like in the exemple&nbsp; and if you're not
	doing this in a test script don't forget to revert the variable back
	after the test. in a test script there is no problems since an exprted
	variable is exported only to the child process
	</ul>
