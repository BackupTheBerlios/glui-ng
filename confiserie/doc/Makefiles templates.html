			<h1>Makefiles</h1>
			<div style="text-align: justify;">confiserie was at first a
				remplacement for configure.... <br>
				but it's hard to have a functional remplacement without taking care of
				the underlying build mechanism....<br>
				Make is the historical tool used to build software. it's a really
				powerfull tool but difficult to use....<br>
				<br>
				every computer science student had used it and had trouble with it,
				because of the needed precision to write Makefiles.....<br>
				<br>
				but Makefile aren't so hard....<br>
				<br>
				if we take advange of some usefull functionalities of gnu Make we can
				even achieve creating makefiles without writing a single line in a
				Makefile....<br>
				<br>
				here are some good exemple of what simplicity confiserie Makefile can
				acheive :<br>
				<a
					href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/confiserie/trunk/confiserie/make_templates/Makefile.app_auto?view=markup">automatic
					C applications creation</a><br>
				<a
					href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/confiserie/trunk/confiserie/make_templates/Makefile.lib_auto?view=markup">automatic
					librairies creation</a><br>
				<br>
				and remember that those are Makefiles : you have access to the whole
				power of make within it, you can then do as you whish, create custom
				rules.... it's up to you<br>
				<br>
				you can find more templates <a
					href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/confiserie/trunk/confiserie/make_templates/">here</a><br>
				<br>
				<h2> how can I tell napper to add a confiserie's Makefile helper in confiserie's DIR?</h2>
				add a line include <ul class="code"> ${confiserie}/helper_makefile</ul>
				include is a function defined in init.sh that do nothing.... the only
				use of this function is to add a line containing the filename of the
				helper makefile<br>
				<br>
				<h2> What
					variables are available to control creation/installation with automatic
					application/library creation?<br>
				</h2>
				<ul class="none">
					<li>*_SCRIPTS : Scripts, nothing is performed appart install</li>
					<li>*_PROGRAMS : C programs</li>
					<ul>
						<li>bin_PROGRAMS : programs installed into ${PREFIX}/bin</li>
						<li>sbin_PROGRAMS: installed into ${PREFIX}/sbin</li>
						<li>noinst_PROGRAMS : programs not installed, created for building
						for exemple</li>
						<li>custom_PROGRAMS : custom programs installed somewhere user must
						define ${CUSTOM_BIN_DIR} env variable, should be used for specific
						application</li>
					</ul>
					<li>	*_XXXPROGRAMS : where XXX is the name of the language to compile with
					(CXX,java....) has the same meaning of above but with special handling of the
					language used</li>
					<li>*_LIBRARIES : libraries</li>
					<ul>
						<li>noinst_LIBRARIES : archive libraries compiled for this
						application and not installed then statically linked</li>
						<li>libexec_LIBRARIES : libraries installed in ${PREFIX}/libexec</li>
						<li>lib_LIBRARIES : shared or archive libraries (depends of extension
						of the library name) installed in ${PREFIX}/lib</li>
						<li>a_LIBRARIES : archive libraries installed in ${PREFIX}/lib</li>
						<li>custom_LIBRARIES : custom libraries installed somewhere, user
						must define ${CUSTOM_LIB_DIR} env variable, should be used for specific
						application</li>
						<li>custom_a_LIBRARIES : custom libraries installed somewhere, user
						must define ${CUSTOM_LIB_DIR} env variable, should be used for specific
						application, this target force use of archives libraries</li>
					</ul>
					<li>	file_CONFIG : configuration file (usualy stored in /etc)</li>
					<li>	file_DATA : various data (usualy stored in /usr/share)</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="note"> note:<br>
					installation require include of Makefile.install helper makefile for file_*
					targets, autolib and autoapp provide installation rules for the
					targets
				</ul>
				<ul class="note"> note:<br> on library version,
					historicaly GNU tools (don't know if this is a common unix behaviour)
					add the version at end of the library name (like libfoo.so.2.4.0) I've
					asked me for long how to specify the version of a library when linking?
					because linking with the previous example is done with -lfoo (the linker
					then add lib and .so to have libfoo.so and look for such file [usually a
					link] then look into this elf for soname properties and link) the
					problem is that if you want to force a library version (for example
					gtk-1) you can't tell the linker about the version with such scheme
					(libgtk.so.1.2.0) BUT if you use the naming scheme libfoo-2.4.0.so
					linking with foo-2.4.0 will have the correct behaviour.... <br>
					usually you only link to a major version (maybe with a revision) and
					then want to link to -l foo-2 rather than foo-2.4 or foo-2.4.0.... the
					trick to achieve this is the same as with the other scheme : make
					simlinks : libfoo.so -&gt; libfoo-2.so -&gt; libfoo-2.4.so -&gt;
					libfoo-2.4.0.so<br>
					confiserie is designed to use this scheme and when using autoinstall
					feature will look for *_VERSION variable where * is one of the library 
					name listed in *_LIBRARIES, it will then make the links<br>
					so to provide library version information : <br>
					lib_LIBRARIES=toto foo	<br>
					toto_VERSION=2.4.8 <br>
					foo_VERSION=1.5.3 <br>
					this will create libtoto-2.4.8.(so/a) libfoo-1.5.3.(so/a) and symlinks<br>
				</ul>
				for each program/library listed in *_PROGRAMS/*_LIBRARIES variable you
				can define the following variable (let's assume your lib/program is
				called toto)<br>
				<ul>
					<li>toto_SOURCES : list toto bin/lib sources, if no sources is
					provided the Makefile assume the program/lib already exist (for exemple
					a shell sript....)</li>
					<li>toto_LDADD : additional libraries to link with, per lib/bin</li>
					<li>toto_ARADD : additional statical archive to add to object list,
					this is for exemple used if you want to specify the path of the archive,
					archives listed here are added to prerequisite list</li>
					<li>toto_MODE : mode for this target only, mode like 644 or a=rx,u+w
					are valid, see man chmod</li>
					<li>toto_OWNER : owner/group for this target only... owners like
					toto:users is valid, see man chown</li>
					<li>toto_VERSION : this is only for libraries, this is used to create the
					name of the library and symlink, and others things (pkg-config....) </li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="note">
					note : <br> the name into *_LIBRARIES
					and *_*PROGRAMS will be modified as follow : <br>
					<ul>
						<li>'-' is replaced by '_'</li>
						<li>'.' is replaced by '_'<br>
						</li>
						<li>'+' is stripped</li>
						<li>ex gtk+-test.truc will have gtk_test_truc_SOURCES<br>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				general variables :<br>
				<ul>
					<li>CFLAGS : C flags shared among all project</li>
					<li>LDFLAGS : idem for linker</li>
					<li>CPPFLAGS: idem for C preprocessor</li>
					<li>CXXFLAGS : idem for C++</li>
					<li>LIB_INSTALL_MODE : octal/chmod flags for libraries</li>
					<li>BIN_INSTALL_MODE : idem for binaries</li>
					<li>SBIN_INSTALL_MODE : idem for sbinaries</li>
					<li>CUSTOM_BIN_INSTALL_MODE : idem for cutom binaries</li>
					<li>LIBEXEC_INSTALL_MODE : idem for libexec libraries</li>
					<li>CUSTOM_LIB_INSTALL_MODE : idem for custom libraries</li>
					<li>same can be done for owner/group by replacing _MODE by owner in
					the previous points _OWNER (ex: LIB_INSTALL_OWNER)<br>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="note"> notes about autolib use<br>
					creation of libraries should not depends on the language used to create
					the objects files, but on the type of objects (ELF....) so linking
					objects into a library only rely on LD....<br>
					that's why to use this functionality you have to include
					${confiserie}/Makefiles/Makefile.autolib<br>
					note that the helper Makefile is located into Makefiles subdir, which
					is dedicated to generic Makefiles...<br>
					<br>
					autolib handle automatically filename extension (ie add automatically
					.a or .so to the created library)<br>
					autolib also handle automatically version if the corresponding
					_VERSION is provided
				</ul>
				<ul class="note">notes about autoapp use<br>
					unlike
					libraries binaries are more troublemakers.... because you need to know
					every libraries required and link with them.... the problem is that some
					libraries are compiler dependant (libgcc_s... ).... this means that you need at option :<br>
					<ul>
						<li>know every univers's compilers and version, and substitute to them</li>
						<li>use the compiler to link</li>
					</ul>
					this means that creating a program will rely on a compiler.... a little
					bit troublemaker.....<br>
					I solved this issue by creating subdirectorie per languages (ie
					${confiserie}/C/ and ${confiserie}/CXX for example) containing each a
					Makefile.autoapp<br>
					a C++ program will likely have in his Makefile a "include
					${confiserie}/CXX/Makefile.autoapp" <br>
					but what if you want in the same Makefile to create both C and C++
					programs? listing them into _PROGRAMS will make hard to determine which
					program is in what language....<br>
					a better solution is to have separate variables : _PROGRAMS are for C
					linkage step, and _CXXPROGRAMS for C++ linkage...<br>
					note that _PROGRAMS can handle fine scripts<br>
				</ul>
				<h2> I don't want to bother with file listing, I want every .c to be listed 
					as source	file of toto?</h2>
				for people that want to make a once for all Makefile (ie never have to
				update the makefile on source addition) they should consider using
				<span class="code">$(shell ls *.c) </span> to create the file list....<br>
				for exemple : 
				<p class="code"> toto_SOURCES=$(shell ls *.c)</p>
				or <p class="code">toto_SOURCES=$(shell find -name *.c)</p>
				<h2> how can I include Makefile.confiserie in my makefile?</h2>
				add a line <br>
				<p class="code">
				include $(TOPSRC_DIR)/Makefile.confiserie
				</p>
				at <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">bottom</span> of your Makefile
				(as a general rule it's safer to include makefiles at end, and as an
				obligatory rule after the variables, I recommand the order
				variables-rules-includes)<br>
				<span class="code">$(TOPSRC_DIR)</span> 
				is a variable you'll set for exemple in you topsource makefile 
				<span class="code"> export TOPSRC_DIR=$(PWD) </span>
			 	that YOU have control on<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>planned but removed:</h2>
				it's planned to have configure script provide librairies
				variables, this means that you won't need to specify -lfoo on
				application/library ldflags but rather use $(LIBFOO)<br>
				this will help provide support for static and dynamic libraries, the
				script will take care to set LIBFOO variable to the correct value (ie
				/usr/lib/libfoo.a or -lfoo according to the build type)<br>
				why did I removed such feature? simply because it isn't needed.... if
				you read some books on gcc/ld you'll find that doing a -ltoto will try
				to find libtoto.so or libtoto.a and to link with... in fact the only way
				to "force" use of a static library is<br>
				<ol>
					<li>to provide full path : solution removed because too complex and I
					prefer to rely on the tool, you may use _ARADD....<br>
					</li>
					<li>add -static (or equivalent option) into LDFLAGS : solution that I
					choosed =&gt;creation of a test to find which flag suit</li>
				</ol>
				<ul class="note"> note <br>
					use instead pkg-config
				</ul>
