cygwin has a some issue with dll names installed

usually on unix env there are the set of symlinks like
libGL.so -> libGL-1.so -> libGL-1.4.so -> libGL-1.4.0.so

cygwin don't provide this and only provide
/bin/cygGL-1.dll

however there is no way (appart brute force) to detect that (maybe in next confiserie)
and the best way is to create the symlinks by hand :

cd /bin
ln -s cygGL-1.dll cygGL.dll
ln -s cygglut-3.dll cygglut.dll
